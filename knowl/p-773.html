<div class="para">Having studied constant coefficient linear ODE's to a satisfactory degree, we now consider the more general case of linear ODE's. Again we will begin with the homogeneous case which appears to us as the equation</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
\dot{\mb{x}} (t) = A(t) \mb{x} (t). \tag{5.5.1}
\end{equation}
</div>
<div class="para">Indeed, we could have written this <span class="process-math">\(\dot{\mb{x}} = A \mb{x}\)</span> as before, so long as we recognize a key difference - <em class="emphasis">the matrix <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is time dependent</em>. It may seem to a student that this is a minor change, but in fact the general equation may now prove nearly impossible to solve. Notwithstanding this potential danger, there are many subclasses of linear ODE's which do admit solutions and whose solutions are of great importance. In this section we give a survey of some standard techniques available to solve some special cases.</div>
