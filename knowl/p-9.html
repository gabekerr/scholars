<div class="para">As it turns out, viewing complex numbers as points on the plane makes more and more sense as you consider their arithmetic. For example, we can think of addition of a given number <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> as an operation on the entire plane at once (in particular as a function) as follows</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
T_z (w ) := w + z.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">If you've never seen <span class="process-math">\(:=\)</span> before, it means we are defining the left hand side by the right hand side. So we think of addition by <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> as a function on all of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{C}\text{.}\)</span> What does it do? Well a little sketching shows that it translates the plane exactly by a vector connecting <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(z\text{.}\)</span> More on this later!</div>
