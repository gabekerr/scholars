<div class="para">Now, we should mentioned that while what we have learned <em class="emphasis">is</em> progress, it also has limitations. The problem is that we have replaced our problem of finding eigenvalues with another problem of finding roots of a polynomial. For small matrices, this problem can be solved with complete accuracy and we will be pleased. However, for larger matrices we get higher degree polynomials. Finding exact roots of such polynomials can be an impossible task (although approximation methods exist). Nevertheless, we should not neglect the fact that we now have a much better understanding of what can happen. In particular, we cannot have infinitely many eigenvalues (in fact the number is bound by the dimension) and they all occur as roots of a polynomial coming directly from the transformation.</div>
