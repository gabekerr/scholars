<div class="para">While this example was a delight to work through, it did raise a question. In general, we expect to obtain <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> different roots to a degree <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> polynomial. This would give us <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> different eigenvectors in a <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> dimensional space. It is natural to ask whether we get a basis from these vectors or not. It is also natural to ask what happened in this example... we only got two vectors!? These types of questions are all about diagonalization.</div>
