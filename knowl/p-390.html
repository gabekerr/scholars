<div class="para">So far, we have avoided the usual undergraduate approach to calling a vector something with a ‘magnitude’ and ‘direction’. The reason for this is that the notion of magnitude is in fact additional data that we <em class="emphasis">impose</em> upon a  vector space. By this I mean that, given a vector <span class="process-math">\(\mb{v}\)</span> in a vector space <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> there is no unique way to assign that vector a length. This is because a vector space should be thought of like a skeleton of a person. It has only enough structure to do vector arithmetic, but not enough to talk about distance and angles. However, we can put some flesh on this skeleton and start working with geometry by adding additional bells and whistles. To do so, we introduce inner product spaces which are vector spaces with an additional pairing.</div>
