</h3>
<div class="para">A very useful geometric picture to have in mind for real vectors in <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> dimensions is the vector space of arrows. We equate two arrows if they have the same magnitude (or length) and the same direction. Adding arrows is accomplished by placing the initial point of one at the endpoint of the other and then drawing an arrow from the remaining initial point to the remaining endpoint. Scalar multiplication is obtained by scaling the magnitude (when the scale is positive) or reversing the direction and scaling (when the scale is negative).</div> <div class="para">This does indeed form a vector space over <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}\text{.}\)</span> It is nearly useless when it comes to computing, but it gives a much better picture of how vectors look and behave. As such, it will reappear frequently as we start applying vectors to ordinary differential equations and multivariable calculus.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-vectorspaces1.html#example-15" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
