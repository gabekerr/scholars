<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Suppose we take the linear differential equation</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
x^\prime (t) \amp = 2x (t) +  y(t), \\
y^\prime (t) \amp = -2 x (t) + 4 y(t). 
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">Writing this out we find the matrix</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
A  = \left[ \begin{matrix} 2 \amp 1 \\ -2 \amp 4 \end{matrix} \right] 
\end{equation*}

<div class="para">and obtain the equation</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\mb{x}^\prime (t) = A \mb{x} (t).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Again, the right hand side is the vector field</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\mb{F} (\mb{x} ) = A \mb{x} 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">and it would be nice to diagonalize <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to get a picture of this field. However, computing the characteristic polynomial gives</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
p_A (s) = \det  \left[ \begin{matrix} s -2 \amp -1 \\ 2 \amp s - 4 \end{matrix} \right] = s^2 - 6 s + 10.

</div>
<div class="para">One can use the quadratic formula here and see that</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
p_A (s) = (s - (3 + i)) (s - (3 - i))
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">so that the roots of <span class="process-math">\(p_A (s)\)</span> are complex numbers and <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> cannot be diagonalized as a real matrix. Now, one of the benefits of having real eigenvalues and eigenvectors was that we obtained a nice picture of the vector field. There is something to be said in the case of a complex eigenvector as well, which is related to several of the exercises that you have worked through. In particular, if there is an eigenvalue of the form <span class="process-math">\(\lambda = re^{i\theta}\text{,}\)</span> then one will see a <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> rotation in the vectors of the vector field (in some coordinate system). For now, we will leave the illustration of this field to a computer and come back to the geometry once we've found the solution.</div>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">To compute the general solution, there are several ways to proceed, but we will take a principled approach and simply say that our path <span class="process-math">\(\mb{x}\)</span> was a function to <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{C}^2\)</span> all along so that</div>

\begin{equation*}
\mb{x} : I \to \mathbb{C}^2.

</div>
<div class="para">Now we can diagonalize because the eigenvalues are distinct. A bit of computation gives the eigenbasis</div>

<div class="para">Again, we can write our solution in terms of this basis</div>

\end{equation}

<div class="para">I can hear the overwhelming chorus of objections to this solution from engineer and mathematician alike. After all, the constants <span class="process-math">\(C_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C_2\)</span> are possibly complex numbers and the function is too. We started in the real plane and have ended in what appears to be a terrifying <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span>-dimensional mess (since <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{C}^2\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> real dimensions).

</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">The first thing to recognize about our solution is that the basis <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{B}\)</span> which we chose  had a hidden symmetry.
