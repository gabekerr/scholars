<div class="para">An astute student may object and note that <span class="process-math">\(f \)</span> is defined to <em class="emphasis">be</em> <span class="process-math">\(gr_f \text{,}\)</span> so why would we call <span class="process-math">\(gr_f \)</span> the graph of the function and not just the function itself? The answer may not satisfy, but in fact a function is often thought of as an assignment, rather than a graph (even though it technically is a graph), so we differentiate the language in order to express the different perspectives. Indeed, the definition given here is an abstract definition but it ties in directly to the computational side through formulas and the geometric perspective by considering the graph.</div>
