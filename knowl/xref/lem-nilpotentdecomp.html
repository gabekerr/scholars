<div class="para">To see the first claim, suppose</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
a_1 \mb{v} + a_2 N(\mb{v}) + \cdots + a_n N^{n - 1} (\mb{v}) = \mb{0}.

<div class="para">Then by taking <span class="process-math">\(N^{n - 1}\)</span> of both sides we see <span class="process-math">\(a_1 = 0\text{.}\)</span> Repeating with <span class="process-math">\(N^{n - 2}, N^{n - 3} , \ldots\)</span> one sees that <span class="process-math">\(a_2, a_3, \ldots\)</span> all must be zero as well implying <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{B}\)</span> is linearly independent.</div>
</div> <div class="para">For the second claim, let we argue by induction on <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(n = 1\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(V = \ker (N)\)</span> and one can take any complementary subspace to the span of <span class="process-math">\(\mb{v}\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> is zero on all of <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> it can be written as <span class="process-math">\(0 \oplus 0\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">So assume the statement is true for <span class="process-math">\((n - 1)\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(W = \ker (N^{n - 1})\text{.}\)</span> Then by the induction hypothesis we can find a complementary subspace <span class="process-math">\(W_2\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(W_1 = \textnormal{span} \{N (\mb{v} ) , \ldots , N^{n - 1} (\mb{v}) \}\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(N = N_1 \oplus N_2\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(U = \{\mb{w} : N (\mb{w} ) \in W_2 \}\)</span> be the vector subspace of <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> consisting of all vectors sent to <span class="process-math">\(W_2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(V_2\)</span> any complementary subspace of <span class="process-math">\(\span \{N^{n - 1} (\mb{v}) \}\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> which contains <span class="process-math">\(W_2\text{.}\)</span> We claim that <span class="process-math">\(V_2\)</span> satisfies the second statement. To check this claim we must verify that <span class="process-math">\(V_2\)</span> maps to itself under <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(V_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(V_2\)</span> are complementary.

</div> <div class="para">Verifying that that <span class="process-math">\(V_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(V_2\)</span> are complementary we first check that their intersection is zero.

Taking <span class="process-math">\(\mb{v}_1 = \tilde{\mb{v}}_1 + a N^{n - 1} (\mb{v}) \in V_1\)</span> we get that <span class="process-math">\(\mb{u}\)</span> is in the span finishing the proof.</div></article></details><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="sec-jnf.html#lem-nilpotentdecomp">in-context</a></span>
