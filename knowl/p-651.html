<div class="para">We recall the discussion from <a href="sec-equation.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.3: Equations Review">SectionÂ 1.3</a> about the fact that in the path setting, we assign a number to each point of the curve. So the path has much more information in it than the curve. In some ways, this information is useful because we can compute. But often, we are not as interested in the extra information as we are the curve itself. For example, we may want to know the length of the curve which does not depend on our parameterization.</div>
