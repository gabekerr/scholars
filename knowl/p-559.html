<div class="para">The key to this observation is the geometric series</div>

\begin{equation*}
( 1 - x)^{-1} = \frac{1}{1 - x} = 1 + x + x^2 + \cdots

<div class="para">that you learn in a first year calculus course. We can manipulate this slightly to see that</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
(y + x)^{-1} = y^{-1} \frac{1}{1 - (-y^{-1} x)} = y^{-1} \left[ 1 + (-y^{-1} x) + (-y^{-1} x)^2 + \cdots \right]

<div class="para">Now, if we try to put random matrices (or linear transformations) in for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> we may run into trouble. First, we would of course need the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> matrix to be invertible to make sense of <span class="process-math">\(y^{-1}\text{,}\)</span> but more importantly, we would need to know this series converged in some reasonable sense. However, if the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> matrix commuted with the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> matrix (which would imply <span class="process-math">\(y^{-1}\)</span> did as well), then the terms</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
(-y^{-1} x)^k = (-1)^k y^{-k} x^k . 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Better yet, if the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> matrix were nilpotent, we would have no concern over convergence because these terms would all be zero once <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is large enough. Taking the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> matrix to represent <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> and the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> matrix to represent <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> thus shows that <span class="process-math">\(S + N\)</span> is invertible (and in fact the formula above can be used to compute the inverse).</div>
