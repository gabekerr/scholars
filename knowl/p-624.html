<div class="para">When modelling a data set, one often will be considering a sample space with several variables. For example, if maple trees were our  our data set, each maple tree may have a height, age, trunk diameter etc. We pick an order of such quantities once and for all so that we can numerically record any such sample as a vector in our vector space <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^n\text{.}\)</span> Doing so with a large data set gives us a large number of vectors <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> and this is where we leave trees behind and math takes over.</div>
