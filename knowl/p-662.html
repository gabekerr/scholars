<div class="para">We should read this last proposition in the following way. Part (1) says that if a path is differentiable, then its coordinate functions are differentiable for any coordinate system you choose. Part (2) is a converse to this - it says if the coordinates of <span class="process-math">\(\mb{r} (t)\)</span> in any given basis are differentiable functions of <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> then so is <span class="process-math">\(\mb{r} (t)\)</span> and furthermore the tangent vector has coordinates that are derivatives of the coordinates. Let us write this as a corollary which is really just a rephrasing of part (2).</div>
