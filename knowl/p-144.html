<div class="para">A couple of comments on this definition are in order. First, we take a basis to be an <em class="emphasis">ordered</em> set of vectors, but often we don't mention the ordering when it plays no role. It is not universally defined this way and occasionally is defined as just a set of vectors satisfying the uniqueness property and equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq-linearcomb.html" title="Equation 2.2.4">(2.2.4)</a>. Second, we defined a finite basis above, but one can also consider infinite ordered sets that are bases (‘bases’ is the plural of basis). However, in the infinite case there are more important variants to the above definition of basis involving infinite sums, so for now we will stick with the finite case.</div>
