<div class="para">To be clear, the abstract notion of a basis is that given in the definition. The computational perspective is that one can uniquely assign arrays of numbers to vectors and, as we will see, add and scalar multiply in an easy fashion. Finally, the geometric perspective is rooted in Descartes original insight that points in space could be given coordinates. This last perspective is extremely subtle in that the word ‘<em class="emphasis">could</em>’ has great importance. I will make the point here that a vector space is a space of vectors or points that does <em class="emphasis">not</em> come with a preferred set of coordinates (unless the space you start with is <span class="process-math">\(K^n\)</span>). Once a basis is given, or chosen, we can then assign coordinates. Indeed, while we do not walk around with a three dimensional grid attached to our head, the space we live in still exists! I may tell you that `the coffee cup is on the table over there', but you will not hear me say ‘the coffee cup is at <span class="process-math">\((-3, 2, 1)\)</span>’.</div>
