<div class="para">On the other hand, equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq-circle.html" title="Equation 1.3.1">(1.3.1)</a> is nearly unique (you can do some silly things like multiply both sides by <span class="process-math">\(2\text{,}\)</span> but this doesn't really change the equation). It does not tell you, for example, that the point on the positive <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis is <span class="process-math">\(\pi / 2\)</span> radians away from the point on the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis. In fact, there is no clearly defined parameter on the points solving it, just the points themselves. This type of equation is often called <em class="emphasis">implicit</em> or a constraint equation because it is not identifying the solutions, but characterizing them implicitly.</div>
