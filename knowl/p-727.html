<div class="para">Having solved homogeneous constant coefficient linear ODE's in principal, we now consider it in practice. It will definitely be helpful for a student to consult online resources and programs, which are plentiful, to visualize the examples in this section.  We will approach these equations computationally and geometrically for this section. Some examples applications will be mentioned towards the end of this section and in the exercises. For each solution, we will want to have the following steps or accomplishments in order to feel good about our final assessment.</div>
