<div class="para">One may ask why column vectors are so popular and there are a couple of very reasonable responses to this question. One is that we can compute very effectively with column vectors (as we will see for the remainder of our lives). Another is that every finite dimensional vector space over <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> is in a very precise sense equivalent to a space of column vectors. This second response is important, but it comes with a caveat which we will discuss when the time comes!</div>
