<div class="para">At this point, let me encourage the student to use Sage to make matrix computations. The syntax for this can be picked up as you go, but we mention a few points. First, a matrix for Sage is a list of lists. Each member list is thought of as a row in the matrix, starting at the top and working down. Try changing a few of the numbers around, the size of the matrix to make sure you are comfortable defining matrices in Sage. <pre class="ptx-sagecell sagecell-sage" id="sage-1"><script type="text/x-sage">A = matrix([[1, 2],[-1, 3]])
A
</script></pre> Now, it is very good to know how to compute by hand, but once you feel comfortable with this, you ought to relax a bit and use your tools. Let's try <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exa-matrixarithmetic.html" title="Example 2.1.4: Arithmetic of square matrices">ExampleÂ 2.1.4</a> with Sage. To do this, we will define each matrix separately and the write the expression we are trying to compute. <pre class="ptx-sagecell sagecell-sage" id="sage-2"><script type="text/x-sage">A = matrix([[1, 4],[-1, 1]])
B = matrix([[0, 1],[1,0]])
C = matrix([[-1,1],[3, -2]])
A*(B + C)
