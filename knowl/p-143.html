<div class="para">As one is often interested in whether a given set of vectors <span class="process-math">\(\{v_1, \ldots, v_m\}\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(K^n\)</span> is a basis, we will assert unambiguously that if there is any hope of this being true, we must have <span class="process-math">\(m = n\)</span> (this will be proven later). Even then, it is not always the case that we have a basis. However, Sage can be used to detect whether a give set of row or column vectors <span class="process-math">\(\{v_1, \ldots, v_n\}\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(K^n\)</span> is a basis. Indeed, one can simply define the vectors, take the span and check that the resulting subspace has dimension <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> Why this works should be rather mysterious to the student at this point, but will be clarified in the coming sections.</div>
