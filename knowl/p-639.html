<div class="para">Now, there are reasons to believe (in certain situations) that our data set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> should be distributed like an ellipse (or an ellipsoid for higher dimensions) around a central point. Such a distribution would be called a multivariate normal distribution. What is meant by `distributed' is that there is some (non-linear) function <span class="process-math">\(\rho\)</span> on <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> which tells us of the probability that a sample point will be in a specific region of <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^n\text{.}\)</span> Then for any probability <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> between <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> there will be ellipsoid ball around the mean in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> for which a sample occuring in that ball will have probability <span class="process-math">\(p\text{.}\)</span>
