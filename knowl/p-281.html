<div class="para">You should look at this diagram in the following way. What we are interested in is the linear transformation <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> so the top row of the diagram is what we care about. But it is abstract and difficult to compute with, so we consider the linear isomorphisms <span class="process-math">\(\coord{}{\mathcal{B}}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\coord{}{\mathcal{C}}\)</span> that place coordinates on <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> respectively and bring us down to earth on the bottom row of the diagram. Down here, <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> have been replaced with column vectors of numbers which we can manipulate with basic arithmetic. But equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq-matrixrepresentation.html" title="Equation 2.6.2">(2.6.2)</a> tells us that we can also work with <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> here as well! In particular, we can write <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> as the concrete matrix of numbers <span class="process-math">\(\cob{T}{\mathcal{B}}{\mathcal{C}}\)</span> and compute <span class="process-math">\(\coord{T(\mb{u})}{\mathcal{C}}\)</span> as matrix multiplication  <span class="process-math">\(\cob{T}{\mathcal{B}}{\mathcal{C}} \coord{\mb{u}}{\mathcal{B}}\text{.}\)</span> Let's see this worked out in an example.</div>
