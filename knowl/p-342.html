<div class="para">You might observe that the formula for <span class="process-math">\(2 \times 2\)</span> determinants had two terms and <span class="process-math">\(3 \times 3\)</span> had six. Were you to write out the formula for <span class="process-math">\(4 \times 4\)</span> matrices, you'd find there are <span class="process-math">\(24\)</span> terms. In fact, the number of terms in the <span class="process-math">\(n \times n\)</span> determinant is <span class="process-math">\(n!\text{,}\)</span> which grows quite quickly. These formulas can be of great use to computers and humans alike for smaller matrices, but for large ones (which occur frequently in applications), they are much less helpful. Nevertheless, there are other ways to compute the determinant of a matrix (for example, it can be done by row reduction) that are faster. More importantly, what we learn by understanding the <em class="emphasis">properties</em> of the determinant gives us great insight into many linear algebra problems.</div>
