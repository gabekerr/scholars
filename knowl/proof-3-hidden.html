<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"><div class="para">The second statement is just the definition of an onto function (that the range equals the codomain). For the first, suppose that <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is one-to-one and <span class="process-math">\(\mb{u}\)</span> is in the kernel <span class="process-math">\(\ker (T)\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(T (\mb{u} ) = \mb{0} = T( \mb{0})\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(\mb{u} = \mb{0}\text{.}\)</span> But since <span class="process-math">\(\mb{u}\)</span> was an arbitrary element of the kernel, this means that the only element of <span class="process-math">\(\ker (T)\)</span> is zero itself.</div> <div class="para logical">

<div class="para">This implies <span class="process-math">\(\mb{u}_1 - \mb{u}_2\)</span> is in the kernel.
