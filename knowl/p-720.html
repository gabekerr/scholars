<div class="para">To compute the general solution, there are several ways to proceed, but we will take a principled approach and simply say that our path <span class="process-math">\(\mb{x}\)</span> was a function to <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{C}^2\)</span> all along so that</div>

<div class="para">Now we can diagonalize because the eigenvalues are distinct. A bit of computation gives the eigenbasis</div>

<div class="para">I can hear the overwhelming chorus of objections to this solution from engineer and mathematician alike. After all, the constants <span class="process-math">\(C_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C_2\)</span> are possibly complex numbers and the function is too. We started in the real plane and have ended in what appears to be a terrifying <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span>-dimensional mess (since <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{C}^2\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> real dimensions). Well, I contend that appearances can be deceiving! Let's unwind this a bit with a few simple observations.</div>
