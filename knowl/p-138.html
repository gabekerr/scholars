<div class="para">As you will show in the exercises, the span of any non-empty subset of a vector space is a vector subspace. However, some sets of vectors are better than others when it comes to spans. For example, the span of the set of all vectors in <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^2\text{,}\)</span> but that is not saying much. On the other hand, the span of the two standard basis vectors <span class="process-math">\(\mb{e}_1, \mb{e}_2\)</span> is also <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^2\text{,}\)</span> yet for these vectors we get a property that we didn't have before.</div>
