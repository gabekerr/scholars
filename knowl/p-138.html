<div class="para">Sage has a class that is a vector space or subspace of another vector space. However, Sage (like us) cares about what <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> is for such a space. Often it is preferable to use the rational numbers <span class="process-math">\(K = \mathbb{Q}\)</span> which Sage writes as QQ. If you evaluate the following snippet, Sage will output a vector subspace which is the span of the two vectors, along with some information about the subspace that is defined. We will learn about these terms in the coming sections.</div>
