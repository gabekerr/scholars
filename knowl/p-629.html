<div class="para">If you have some familiarity with basic statistics, you will know that finding the average (or mean) of a data set is only the first step in understanding your distribution of points. The second step is to find the variance, which when <span class="process-math">\(n = 1\text{,}\)</span> is the average of the squares of the deviations from the mean. In other words, it can be calculated as</div>

\frac{\sum (X - \mu)^2}{|S|}.\tag{4.3.3}

<div class="para">This is actually the population variance, which will do for our purposes in one dimension. What it measures is how far away (or more precisely, the square of the distance away) a generic sample point is from the mean. However, we have by now realized our world is much richer with many dimensions and we should also note that the words `far away' indicate an inner product computation in many dimensions. So our notion of variance should also certainly be much richer in many dimensions and indeed it is.</div>
