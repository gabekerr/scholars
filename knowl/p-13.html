<div class="para">Upon seeing this, you may say ‘So what's the big deal?’ After all, this is some equation that relates a tremendously confusing expression <span class="process-math">\(e^{i \theta}\)</span> to a newly introduced set of complex numbers. Let's take a closer look though to see the power contained in this equation. For a fixed <span class="process-math">\(\theta\text{,}\)</span> the right hand side is just a complex number, which we've identified with the point <span class="process-math">\((\cos \theta , \sin \theta )\)</span> on the plane. That type of point should look familiar to you because it lies on the unit circle making an angle of <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> with the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis. Moreover, all points on the unit circle are of this form. So our first observation is that the unit circle is the set of points hit by exponentiating a purely imaginary number... which is pretty cool.</div>
