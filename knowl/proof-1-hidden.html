<div class="para">We need to show both that a one-to-one correspondence has an inverse and that a function with an inverse is a one-to-one correspondence. Let's start with the latter and assume <span class="process-math">\(f \)</span> has an inverse <span class="process-math">\(g \text{.}\)</span> To see that <span class="process-math">\(f \)</span> is one-to-one, suppose <span class="process-math">\(f(a_0) = f(a_1) \text{.}\)</span> Then</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
a_0 = 1_A (a_0) = (g \circ f) (a_0) = g(f(a_0)) = g(f(a_1)) = (g \circ f) (a_1) = 1_A (a_1) = a_1,
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">showing that <span class="process-math">\(f \)</span> is one-to-one. To see that <span class="process-math">\(f \)</span> is onto, simply observe that for any <span class="process-math">\(b \in B \text{,}\)</span> we have that <span class="process-math">\(b = 1_B (b) = (f \circ g) (b) = f (g(b)) \)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(b \)</span> is in the range of <span class="process-math">\(f \)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f \)</span> is onto.</div>
</div> <div class="para">Now for the converse. Suppose <span class="process-math">\(f \)</span> is a one-to-one correspondence and let <span class="process-math">\(b \)</span> be any element of <span class="process-math">\(B \text{.}\)</span> Then, since <span class="process-math">\(f \)</span> is onto, there is some <span class="process-math">\(a \)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(A \)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(f(a) = b \text{.}\)</span> We define <span class="process-math">\(g(b) = a \text{.}\)</span> To see that this makes sense, we need to verify (*) in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def-function.html" title="Definition 1.2.6">DefinitionÂ 1.2.6</a> and show that <span class="process-math">\(a \)</span> is unique. But if <span class="process-math">\(f(a^\prime) = b \)</span> for some other <span class="process-math">\(a^\prime \)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(A \text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f \)</span> is not one-to-one, so <span class="process-math">\(a \)</span> must be unique implying <span class="process-math">\(g \)</span> is a function. It is clear that <span class="process-math">\((g \circ f) (a) = g(b) = a \)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(g \circ f = 1_A \)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((f \circ g) (b) = f(a) = b \)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(f \circ g = 1_B \text{.}\)</span> Thus <span class="process-math">\(g \)</span> is an inverse function to <span class="process-math">\(f \text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">For the last statement about the uniqueness of the function <span class="process-math">\(g \text{,}\)</span> one considers what would happen if <span class="process-math">\(h \)</span> were another inverse. Then for any <span class="process-math">\(b \)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(B \text{,}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
h(b) = (h \circ 1_B ) (b) = (h \circ f \circ g) (b) = (1_A \circ g) (b) = 1_A (g(b)) = g(b).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">But this means that <span class="process-math">\(h = g \)</span> as a function and <span class="process-math">\(g \)</span> is the unique inverse.</div>
