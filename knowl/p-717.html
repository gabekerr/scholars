<div class="para">In this section, we will look at and solve our first non-trivial ordinary differential equation. First though, we recall what it is that we are trying to solve. Quite generally, let <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> be a finite dimensional inner product space and <span class="process-math">\(\mb{F}_t : V \to V\)</span> be a collection of functions, one for every <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> in some interval <span class="process-math">\(I\text{.}\)</span> This collection should be thought of as a time varying <dfn class="terminology">vector field</dfn>, which we will study in later sections. The general ordinary differential equation can be written</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
\dot{\mb{x}}  = \mb{F}_t ( \mb{x}).\tag{5.2.1}
\end{equation}
</div>
<div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">particular solution</dfn> to this equation is simply some path <span class="process-math">\(\mb{x} (t)\)</span> that satisfies this equation. However, just as is the case with solving a linear system of equations, we can ask for a <dfn class="terminology">general solution</dfn> which will include parameters and give all solutions to our equation. Sadly, for most ODEs, finding any closed form solution is out of the question. Nonetheless, we will see a theorem assuring us that a solution exists (under some mild conditions on <span class="process-math">\(\mb{F}_t\)</span>) and that, once the initial condition <span class="process-math">\(\mb{x} (0)\)</span> is fixed, this solution is unique. Let us state this last fact as a ‘theorem’ that will be proved later.</div>
