<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">In this section, we will look at and solve our first non-trivial ordinary differential equation. First though, we recall what it is that we are trying to solve. Quite generally, let <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> be a finite dimensional inner product space and <span class="process-math">\(\mb{F}_t : V \to V\)</span> be a collection of functions, one for every <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> in some interval <span class="process-math">\(I\text{.}\)</span> This collection should be thought of as a time varying <dfn class="terminology">vector field</dfn>, which we will study in later sections. The general ordinary differential equation can be written</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/eq-generalODE.html">
\begin{equation}
\dot{\mb{x}}  = \mb{F}_t ( \mb{x}).\tag{5.2.1}
\end{equation}
</div>
<div class="para">For the moment, we consider the meaning of this equation when</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/eq-generalODE.html">
\begin{equation*}
\mb{F}_t = \mb{F} 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">is independent of time (the so-called autonomous differential equation). For any point <span class="process-math">\(\mb{x}\text{,}\)</span> we can then picture <span class="process-math">\(\mb{F} (\mb{x} )\)</span> as a vector with initial point at <span class="process-math">\(\mb{x}\text{.}\)</span> Indeed, we write <span class="process-math">\(T_\mb{x} V\)</span> for a copy of the vector space <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(\mb{x}\)</span> and call this the <dfn class="terminology">tangent space</dfn> of <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(\mb{x}\)</span> (we do this for every vector in <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span>). We then illustrate <span class="process-math">\(\mb{F}\)</span> as a collection of different tangent vectors, one for each point in the the domain of <span class="process-math">\(\mb{F}\text{.}\)</span> This is called a <dfn class="terminology">vector field</dfn>. We can use sage to illustrate this perspective and graph a vector field. Evaluate the sage cell to see a two dimensional example. <pre class="ptx-sagecell sagecell-sage" id="sage-9"><script type="text/x-sage">x,y = var('x y')
plot_vector_field((-4*x - 3*y,6*x + 5*y), (x,-3,3), (y,-3,3))
</script></pre> Or evaluate this cell to see a three dimensional example. <pre class="ptx-sagecell sagecell-sage" id="sage-10"><script type="text/x-sage">x,y,z = var('x y z')
plot_vector_field3d((-y, x, z),
        (x,-2,2), (y,-2,2), (z,-2,2))
</script></pre> Now, consider a solution to equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq-generalODE.html" title="Equation 5.2.1">(5.2.1)</a>. Such a path <span class="process-math">\(\mb{x} (t)\)</span> will have its tangent vector at time <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> precisely equal to the vector field at the position <span class="process-math">\(\mb{x}(t)\text{.}\)</span> In simple terms, the path is following the flow of the field - at each point, its direction and speed are determined by <span class="process-math">\(\mb{F}\text{.}\)</span> A <dfn class="terminology">particular solution</dfn> to this equation is simply some path <span class="process-math">\(\mb{x} (t)\)</span> that satisfies this equation. However, just as is the case with solving a linear system of equations, we can ask for a <dfn class="terminology">general solution</dfn> which will include parameters and give all solutions to our equation. Sadly, for most ODEs, finding any closed form solution is out of the question. Nonetheless, we will see a theorem assuring us that a solution exists (under some mild conditions on <span class="process-math">\(\mb{F}_t\)</span>) and that, once the initial condition <span class="process-math">\(\mb{x} (0)\)</span> is fixed, this solution is unique. Let us state this last fact as a ‘theorem’ that will be proved later.</div>
