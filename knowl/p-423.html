<div class="para">Now that we have a way to discuss length and angles, a whole new set of questions arises. For example, when we put a coordinate chart on an inner product space, we may want this chart to have axes that are perpendicular to each other. We may also want the coordinates to agree with some unit length so that, for example, the vector with coordinates <span class="process-math">\((0, 1, 0)\)</span> has length <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> Perhaps you will be pleasantly surprised that such notions have names and many of the details concerning them have been worked out completely. We will cover some of them in this section.</div>
