<div class="para">There are two examples of quadratic forms for <span class="process-math">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span> that you see early in your mathematical education. We will write these as functions of two variables. The first is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
Q_{++} (x,y) =  Q_{++} \left( \twovec{x}{y} \right)  = \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The level set of this quadratic form, which is defined as the set of points in the plane satisfying <span class="process-math">\(Q (x, y) = c\text{,}\)</span> is an ellipse. Another quadratic form you see is the similar looking</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
Q_{+-} (x,y) =  Q_{+-} \left( \twovec{x}{y} \right)  = \frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The level set here being a hyperbola. Of course, there are others like</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
Q(x, y) = 5x^2 - 6xy + 5y^2
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">but, as we will see using the Spectral Theorem, this can be made to be like one of our two prototypes above by changing coordinates.</div>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">We note here that instead of considering the level curves of these quadratic forms, we could consider their graphs</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\{ (x, y, z) : z = Q (x,y) \} \subset \mathbb{R}^3 . 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">In this case, we would obtain what are known as the paraboloid and hyperbolic paraboloid. We will revisit these graphs later on when we consider multivariable scalar functions.</div>
