<div class="para">A very useful geometric picture to have in mind for real vectors in <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> dimensions is the vector space of arrows. We equate two arrows if they have the same magnitude (or length) and the same direction. Adding arrows is accomplished by placing the initial point of one at the endpoint of the other and then drawing an arrow from the remaining initial point to the remaining endpoint. Scalar multiplication is obtained by scaling the magnitude (when the scale is positive) or reversing the direction and scaling (when the scale is negative).</div>
